# Files description: Understanding the package and its structure

##################################
# The build directory is used to store temporary build files generated during the package build process.

##################################
# The build\bdist.win-amd64 directory contains the built distribution files of the package.
# These files are created when the package is built using the python setup.py bdist command.
# The built distribution files are platform-specific and are used to distribute the package to users who have the same platform.

##################################
# The dist directory contains the built distribution files of the package.
# These files are created when the package is built using the python setup.py sdist command.
# it contains a .egg file, which is a compressed archive of the package's source code and metadata.

##################################
# The notebooks directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the package.
# Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations.
# They are commonly used for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
# In this case, the notebooks directory contains notebooks that demonstrate how to use the d2c package for causal discovery and time series analysis.
# The notebooks are organized into subdirectories based on different topics or use cases.

##################################
# The src directory is the root directory of the package.
# It contains the package's source code, data files, documentation, and tests.
# The structure of a package is usually organized in a hierarchical manner, with subpackages representing different components or functionalities of the package.
# In this case the src directory contains the d2c package, which is the main package of the project.
# d2c package contains benchmark, causeme, data_generation and descriptors subpackages.
# Each subpackage contains modules that implement specific functionalities of the package.
# in this case:
# - benchmark subpackage contains: __init__.py, base.py, metrics.py, cd_plot.py, d2c_wrapper.py, dynotears.py, granger.py,
#   var.py, varlingam.py, test.py and pcmci.py.
# - causeme subpackage contains: __init__.py and causeme_example.py.
# - data_generation subpackage contains: __init__.py, builder.py, models.py and utils.py
# - descriptors subpackage contains: __init__.py, d2c.py, estimators.py, loader.py, test_loader.py and utils.py
# __init__.py files are used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories.
# src directory also caintains d2c.egg-info directory, which contains: PKG-INFO, SOURCES.txt, dependency_links.txt, requires.txt and top_level.txt
# These files contain metadata about the package, such as its name, version, dependencies, and source files.

##################################
# The tests directory contains unit tests for the package.
# Unit tests are used to verify that individual components of the package work correctly.
# They are typically written using a testing framework such as pytest or unittest.
# In this case, the tests directory contains test modules that test the functionality of the d2c package.
# The test modules are organized into subdirectories based on different components or functionalities of the package.
# For example, the tests directory contains subdirectories for the benchmark, data_generation, and descriptors subpackages.
# Each subdirectory contains test modules that test the functionality of the corresponding subpackage.
# For example, the benchmark subdirectory contains test_d2c_wrapper.py, which works like this:
# at first, it imports the d2c package and the pytest module.
# then, it defines a test function that uses the pytest fixture to set up the test environment.
# it creates a d2c_wrapper object and calls its fit() method with some sample data.
# finally, it uses the assert statement to check that the fit() method returns the expected output.

##################################
# The LICENSE file specifies the terms and conditions under which the package can be used, modified, and distributed.

##################################
# The README.md file is a markdown file that contains information about the package, such as its name, description, and usage instructions.

##################################
# The setup.py file is a configuration file that tells setuptools about your package (such as its name, version, and dependencies). 
# In this case, the setup() function is called with the following arguments: name, version, packages, package_dir, and install_requires. 
# It tells setuptools to look for packages in the src directory. 
# The package_dir argument specifies that the package's root directory is the src directory.
# The install_requires argument lists the package's dependencies.
# These dependencies are other Python packages that must be installed for the package to work correctly.
# The find_packages() function is used to automatically discover all packages and subpackages in the src directory.
# src directory is the root directory of the package: it contains the package's source code and other files 
# (such as data files, documentation, and tests).
